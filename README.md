# Safe Auto-Swap Sandbox for 0G Labs Testnet and Jaine App üß™üõ°Ô∏è

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-v0.1.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/christox390/auto-swap-jaine-app-0g-labs/releases)

A clean, ethical playground to study automated interactions on the 0G Labs testnet with the Jaine App. This repository documents a safe, educational harness that demonstrates how to manage wallets, simulate token allowances, and orchestrate transactions in a controlled test environment. It is designed for learning, auditing, and improving the reliability of tooling for blockchain devs. It does not advocate real asset transfers or attempts to game any reward programs. The focus is on infrastructure, testing, and responsible automation.

## Overview

This project provides a structured blueprint for building an automated testnet interaction harness. It emphasizes safe, compliant testing on the 0G Labs testnet and similar environments. You will learn how to:

- Manage multiple wallets in a sandboxed setting.
- Model token allowances and ERC-20 interactions in a non-production context.
- Capture and analyze on-chain activity to validate behavior, not to abuse a rewards system.
- Log results comprehensively for audits, demonstrations, and reproducibility.

The repository stays focused on architecture, observability, and safety without prescribing or enabling actions that could undermine fair access to testnet rewards or any live networks. All workflows are designed to run with testnet assets and ephemeral data.

---

## Why this project exists

- Provide a transparent, educational path for developers to understand automated blockchain workflows.
- Offer a reusable blueprint for building compliant test automation around wallet operations, token approvals, and transaction sequencing.
- Encourage best practices in observability, security, and governance for on-chain tooling.

This work is not a recipe to exploit airdrops or manipulate reward systems. It is an instrument for learning, testing, and improving the reliability of blockchain tooling in a responsible way.

---

## Architecture and Core Components

The harness is built around four pillars that interact in a safe, modular fashion:

1) Wallet Manager
- Responsible for creating and handling multiple test wallets.
- Uses non-production mnemonics stored securely, with clear separation from any real funds.
- Provides deterministic address generation for repeatable tests.

2) Market Simulator
- Models swap-like actions in a controlled mock or sandboxed environment.
- Emulates price feeds and slippage in a deterministic way to support reproducible tests.
- Keeps thorough logs of simulated decisions without touching real markets.

3) Transaction Orchestrator
- Coordinates sequences of actions (approve, transfer, swap) within safety boundaries.
- Enforces rate limits and guardrails to ensure tests stay on the intended surface area.
- Interfaces with a mock or testnet RPC to validate end-to-end flows without risking real assets.

4) Compliance and Observability Layer
- Captures events, errors, and performance metrics.
- Provides dashboards and exportable data for audits, reviews, and learning outcomes.
- Enforces policy checks to prevent unsafe or unintended actions.

Supporting services
- Local blockchain simulators or testnet nodes (e.g., Hardhat, Ganache, or dedicated testnets).
- Scriptable test data and fixtures for reproducible runs.
- Documentation and examples that illustrate safe usage patterns.

---

## Guidelines for Use (Safe and Responsible)

- Always operate with testnet funds and testnet tokens only.
- Use ephemeral wallets for each test run to avoid cross-contamination of test data.
- Do not deploy or run any components against live networks in this project.
- Log and monitor all actions; maintain transparency for audits and demonstrations.
- Contribute with a focus on reliability, security, and clear governance around access to keys and credentials.

---

## Getting Started (Safe and Reproducible)

Note: This guide focuses on safe setup for a development machine. It assumes you have a basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript development and local blockchain tooling.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version, 18.x or newer recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- A local blockchain environment (Hardhat or Ganache) or access to a dedicated testnet node
- Git for cloning

Initial setup
- Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/christox390/auto-swap-jaine-app-0g-labs.git
- Install dependencies
  - npm install
  - or yarn install

Configuration
- Create a safe environment configuration file (for example, .env.local) that includes:
  - TESTNET_RPC_URL: the RPC endpoint for your testnet or local node
  - MNEMONIC: a test mnemonic generated for sandbox wallets (store securely)
  - GAS_LIMITS: standard gas settings for test runs
  - LOG_LEVEL: debug, info, warning, error
- Do not commit credentials to version control.

Running a safe test
- Start the local blockchain or connect to a testnet node
- Boot the harness with a safe profile
  - npm run test:safe
  - This runs a constrained set of actions in a no-risk sandbox
- Observe logs and dashboards
  - Check the on-screen console and log files to confirm that wallet creation, approval handling, and transaction sequencing occur as intended in the sandbox

Reproducible experiments
- Use deterministic wallet seeds and block timings
- Pin the version of dependencies to avoid drift
- Record all inputs and outputs to enable exact replays of test runs

---

## How It Works (High-Level)

- Wallets: The system creates a set of transient wallets for testing. Each wallet is isolated, with its own private data that never leaves the sandbox.
- Allowances: ERC-20-esque interactions are modeled in a safe context. Allowances can be simulated to verify approval flows without transferring real tokens.
- Orchestration: A sequence engine runs a sequence of approved, constrained actions. It enforces policies like rate limits and safe gas usage.
- Logging: Every operation is logged with timestamps, wallet identifiers, and outcomes. Logs enable audits and learning from test runs.
- Observability: A lightweight dashboard or log viewer shows current states and historical results. This helps you verify that the system behaves as expected.

Directory notes
- Each module is designed to be swapped out for alternative implementations. You can replace the simulator with your own deterministic model, or swap the logger with a different backend, without changing the core orchestration.

---

## Security and Privacy by Design

- Secrets and keys live in environment variables or secure vaults, never in the codebase.
- All test artifacts are non-production and segregated from any live data.
- Access to wallets, keys, and RPC endpoints is restricted to your local environment or CI systems with proper protections.
- Data retention is minimized; logs are rotated and purged according to a defined policy.
- The project emphasizes auditability. Every action can be traced back to a test run, a wallet, and a timestamp.

---

## Testing and Quality

- Unit tests cover core components like Wallet Manager, Market Simulator, and Transaction Orchestrator.
- Integration tests ensure end-to-end flows work in a sandboxed environment.
- Linting and type checks enforce code quality and readability.
- CI pipelines run on push and pull request events to validate changes before they land in main branches.
- Security reviews are part of the workflow for any changes that touch credentials handling or RPC interactions.

---

## Documentation and Learning Resources

- Architecture and design rationale explain why each component exists and how they interact.
- How-to guides show best practices for safe sandboxing, reproducible experiments, and governance around test automation.
- API references provide stable interfaces for wallet operations, approvals, and transaction sequencing.
- Troubleshooting tips help you diagnose common issues in local or remote sandboxed environments.

Images and visuals
- Emojis and simple diagrams illustrate concepts like wallets, approvals, and transactions in a friendly way.
- If you include project visuals, prefer open-licensed or self-created assets that reflect the sandbox nature of the work.
